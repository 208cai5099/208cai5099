- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhuo, a former middle and high school STEM teacher. Yes, I've taught math and science before. Yes, math and science are hard. But everyone can learn them once given the right resources and effort.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about programming, especially in its use in data analytics and data science. I wish to apply what I've learned about teaching to further improve the products and services offered by educational organizations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and planning to learn SQL and R real soon :)
