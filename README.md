- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhuo, a former middle and high school science and math teacher from New York City.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about programming, especially in its use in data analytics and data science. I wish to apply what I've learned about teaching to further improve the products and services offered by educational organizations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python. I learned the fundamentals of SQL and R before, but I didn't use them much afterwards. Planning on re-learning them soon :)
